This is the code repository for the ICLR 2023 paper [How Much Space Has Been Explored? Measuring the Chemical Space Covered by Databases and Machine-Generated Molecules](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Yo06F8kfMa1).

Chemical space measures including `#Circles` as we proposed in the paper are defined in `measures.py`.
