## Introduction to `Dock`

### `autobook_scripts`
The files in this directory are primarily used for the receptor preparation of the HDAC6 target and are generally not used.  

### `maps`
This directory contains the affinity maps for all test targets.  
We recommend directly downloading and using the affinity maps from this directory when performing docking with AutoDock-Vina to save time.  
All map files can be downloaded via [Here](todo)

### `pdbqtfiles`
This directory includes the pdbqt files for all targets.  
The pdbqt files can be used for automatical preparation, except for the affinity maps of HDAC6 and the two holo proteins.
